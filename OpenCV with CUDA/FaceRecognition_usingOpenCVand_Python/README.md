# Face Recognition Using OpenCV and Python

* The Objective of this project is to detect faces. `OpenCV` uses `machine learning algorithms` to search for faces within a picture. Because faces are so complicated, there isn’t one simple test that will tell you if it found a face or not. Instead, there are thousands of small patterns and features that must be matched. The algorithms break the task of identifying the face into thousands of smaller, bite-sized tasks, each of which is easy to solve. These tasks are also called `classifiers`.
